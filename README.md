## MAS480: Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning - final project

This repository contains the final project for the course MAS480: Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning (Fall, 2022) in KAIST.

The project aims to show the application of **PINN**(**P**hysics-**I**nformed **N**eural **N**etworks) to solve a real world problem related to a PDE.

In this project, I have chosen to solve the **Level-Set Equation** which describes how the fire front will expands over time. To gather the data, I have used the *imageJ* to determine the location of the points in fire front at each time step.

The project is implemented in Python using the Jax library.
